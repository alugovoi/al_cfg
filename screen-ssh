To have SSH within a screen session use the symlink, add the following line to ~/.screenrc:

setenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK $HOME/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
To update the symlink we'll use the ~/.ssh/rc file which is executed by SSH on each connection. This can be any executable file, so something like the following script will do:

if test "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ; then
    ln -sf $SSH_AUTH_SOCK ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
fi
